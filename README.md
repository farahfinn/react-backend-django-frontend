# react-frontend-django-backend-starter

This is a template kit for starting a react front-end app with a django server and backend. There are multiple ways of serving the back-end e.g using Django-rest framework to serve the API's. In this case however, the API's will be manipulated in the views.py file.

In the `package.json` file add `--watch` to the dev scripts. I didn't because of some errors thrown when using WSL2 in windows.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` for python dependencies i.e Django.

Run `npm install` to get all node dependencies.
